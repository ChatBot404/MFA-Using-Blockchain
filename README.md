# MFA-Using-Blockchain
A decentralized authentication system combining blockchain and MFA for enhanced security. Built with Solidity, Python, and Web3.js, it features cryptographic hashing, dynamic OTPs, and Ethereum smart contracts. Python powers backend logic, while JavaScript ensures seamless UI integration, offering scalability and robust error handling.
The smart contract securely stores user credentials using hashed passwords and unique salts, eliminating the vulnerabilities of centralized storage. OTPs are generated dynamically using blockchain entropy, enhancing unpredictability and user data protection. The Python backend seamlessly interacts with the blockchain, handling smart contract deployment, transaction confirmations, and secure hashing.

The JavaScript-based frontend provides a dynamic and user-friendly interface, updating users in real time with authentication status and progress indicators. With features like decentralized credential storage, detailed error handling, and scalable architecture, this system is ideal for applications in industries like banking, healthcare, IoT, and e-governance.

This project exemplifies how blockchain's immutability and transparency can transform traditional authentication systems into secure, future-ready solutions.
